# Pounds (lbs) Converter

A simple vanilla JavaScript pounds(lbs) converter I learned to make watching Brad Traversey's [Simple Weight Converter App With JavaScript & Bootstrap 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l-ZAuU8TXc&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=9&t=0s) video on YouTube.

Since I have been practicing basic JavaScript a lot lately, I am proud to say I was able to finish the JavaScript before he did in the video!
