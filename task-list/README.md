# Task List

A task list app where users can add/remove and filter tasks of their choice.

I made this as a part of Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) Udemy Course.

This was the first project in the course, and building it we used what was covered up until then:

- Basic DOM Manipulation
- Using Local Storage
