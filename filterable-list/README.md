# Filterable List App
This simple app allows users to filter out names they want to see based on what is typed in the input field.

I learned to build this app alongside Brad Traversy in his [Build A Filterable List With Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eW3Oi6uoc&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=7) video on YouTube.

### Things I learnt building this project
- Using toUpperCase() to ensure consistency between what's typed and matching a listed name
