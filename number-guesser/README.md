# Number Guesser

A basic number guessing game.

I learned to build this project as part of Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) Udemy Course.

### What I learned building this project:

- Using Skeleton CSS for the UI
- Change HTML element text content using JavaScript
- Displaying a message dynamically based on player input
- Using isNaN function for input validation
- Use of event delegation in a project
