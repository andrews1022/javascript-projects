# JavaScript Projects

This is a collection of vanilla JavaScript projects from various sources (my own, YouTube, Udemy, etc.). Use them as a reference, inspiration, or make them better!

Another good idea would be to take these and re-create them with either TypeScript or a front end framework of your choice as practice if you're starting out with any of those!
