# Create a Custom PDF Viewer With JavaScript

This project was build alongside Brad Traversy in his [Pure JavaScript Type Writer Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POX3dT-pB4E&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=17) YouTube video.

### Things I learned in this crash course:

- Further practice with using:
  - Classes
  - .this
  - constructor()
- Setting and customizing custom made HTML data- attributes
